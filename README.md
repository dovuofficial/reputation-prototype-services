## Reputational Insurance prototypes webservices

This is a small API with an admin panel to allow us to manage projects and track staked tokens in a way that allows us to not have to communicate with the contract all of the time.

For all documentation purposes please look at the postman collection that is included inside of this project.

## Overview

In short, the API provides functionality for two main purposes:

- Project management as a CRUD
- Tracking account stakes for a given project as a CRUD

In addition, the admin panel provided has a nice UI layout for those that want to adjust by hand...
